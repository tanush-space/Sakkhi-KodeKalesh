# 🌸 Sakkhi — Your Companion for Postpartum Healing (Team : CodeZen)

> “We ask about the baby. But who asks the mother how she’s doing?”

Sakkhi is **India’s first mother-first emotional wellness platform**, helping postpartum moms track healing through mood, voice, rituals, and community — all in a culturally sensitive, zero-judgment space.

## ✅ Post-Deadline Deployment Note [10-07-2025 12:15 AM]

We completed all development work, features, final touches, and deployment *before the official deadline (09-07-2025 11:30 PM)*.

However, some of the final commits were not reflecting on the deployed link due to syncing delays.

We reached out to the organizer *Ayan Ahmed Khan, and with his permission, we redeployed the **same project without any code changes* to ensure the live version reflects our actual final work.
 
🕒 Only the deployment was refreshed to sync with the latest commits.

✅ Organizer Permission Confirmed by: *Ayan Ahmed Khan (HackOrbit Team)*

## 🧠 Problem Statement

- 75%+ Indian mothers feel overwhelmed postpartum.  
- 22% suffer from postpartum depression, 80% go undiagnosed.  
- Every digital tool is baby-focused. *No one asks the mother how she’s doing.*

📰 Real stories show the urgency:
- Women setting themselves on fire
- Infanticide driven by untreated postpartum psychosis
- Young Indian mothers silently suffering

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Sakkhi is a digital platform that **centers the mother’s emotional healing**. Not a parenting app. Not a milestone tracker. Just a gentle space to reconnect with self.

What Sakkhi offers:
- Tracks emotional well-being (mood + voice logs)
- Builds a personal healing timeline
- Offers culturally sensitive rituals and support
- Enables optional peer support rooms based on lived experience

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ **Suno Khud Ko**: Mood and voice check-ins analyzed using NLP  
- 🪞 **MyReflection**: Auto-built healing timeline  
- 🧘 **SootheSpace**: 3-min micro-rituals (breathe, affirm, ground)  
- 🫂 **Circle of One**: Anonymous support rooms based on experience  
- 📚 **Bharosa Library**: Stories from Indian moms who broke the silence  

---

## 🌈 What Makes It Unique

- 🧠 100% *mother-first* lens (no baby milestone tracking)
- 🪶 Quiet, ad-free, judgment-free healing corner
- 🇮🇳 Culturally contextual UX (joint families, stigma, language)
- 🎤 Voice journaling + emotion analysis using HuggingFace NLP
- 📈 Visual identity timeline – emotional journey becomes visible
- 🔒 Anonymous + encrypted. Built for trust and privacy

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

The entire platform is fully responsive.  
Whether you're using a phone, tablet, or desktop, the experience adapts smoothly and maintains usability across all devices.

## 🧩 Our Approach (Based on Human-Centered Design)

Sakkhi is thoughtfully built using the principles of **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** — where every decision stems from the real, lived experiences of postpartum mothers.

### 🌱 Phase-wise Development Strategy

1. **Empathize – Understanding Real Needs**
   - We explored actual case studies, journal articles, and real news stories to uncover how overlooked postpartum mental health is in India.
   - The pain points were emotional, cultural, and deeply personal — not just medical.

2. **Define – Framing the Right Problem**
   - Instead of focusing on the baby or parenting, we framed the platform entirely around the mother’s healing journey.
   - We aimed to remove pressure, judgment, and performance-based engagement from the experience.

3. **Ideate – Designing a Safe, Gentle Space**
   - Brainstormed features that respect emotional pacing: mood & voice check-ins, journaling, soothing rituals, optional support rooms.
   - Prioritized calmness, softness, and privacy over engagement or “growth hacking.”

4. **Prototype – Fast, Modular, Functional**
   - Set up a scalable React + Node architecture with clear routing and separate logic layers.
   - Created responsive, low-distraction UIs that are responsive and bandwidth-friendly.

5. **Test & Iterate – Learn & Refine**
   - Took feedback from mentors and peers at every checkpoint.
   - Improved tab functionality, responsiveness, and flow based on real-time testing.

> “This isn't just an MVP. Sakkhi is a space that *listens* before it speaks — built slowly, carefully, and humanely.”
